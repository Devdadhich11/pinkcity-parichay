Jai Singh II chose to establish a new city due to the inadequacies of the old capital, Amber, which was facing problems like overcrowding and water scarcity. He envisioned a city that would not only be strategically located but also embody the principles of Vastu Shastra (traditional Indian architecture) and Shilpa Shastra (Indian sculpture techniques).</p>
                    <p><b>City Planning and Design:</b><br> The design of Jaipur was meticulously planned. The city was laid out in a grid pattern, which was innovative for its time. The central part of the city was divided into nine blocks, with two blocks designated for the royal palace and public buildings, and the remaining seven for residential and commercial purposes. The city was surrounded by a fortified wall with seven gates</p>
